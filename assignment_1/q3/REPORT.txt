Question 1: Start your TCP client application without the TCP server running. What happens? Why?
Ans:
When the TCP client application is started before the TCP server is running the program terminates saying unable to
connect to server. This happens because the connect() function returns an error since it is unable to find a running 
server at the address provided


Question 2: Start your UDP client application without the UDP server running. What happens? Why?
Ans:
When the UDP client application is started before the UDP server is running, no error is thrown because in UDP 
we don't need to connect our client to a specific server address. The client would appear to work fine however it would
not receive any acknowledgements or reply back from the server as the server is not running.
